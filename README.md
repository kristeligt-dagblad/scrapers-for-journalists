# scrapers-for-journalists
Scraper(s) to help the journalists retrieve data or monitor sites for potential leads for stories

 - **Tools?** To build new scrapers, try to keep the dependencies to a minimum. You can do a lot with just requests and BeautifulSoup.
 - **Automation?** To make scheduled runs, we are using Github Actions, as the workloads are relatively short-running.
 - **Data storage?** Data is uploaded to [...]

Every file in `utils/`can be imported in your scrapers, as it is added as a package in pyproject.toml. For example, you can import the BaseScraper with generic utilities like: `from base import BaseScraper`.

## Description of current scrapers
